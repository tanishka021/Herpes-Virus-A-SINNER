    <div> <h2> About HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS</h2>
    <DIV><p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can infect many different parts of your body, most commonly your mouth area (oral herpes) and genitals (genital herpes). HSV causes fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over wherever the infection is. This is known as a herpes outbreak. But it’s also possible to have no symptoms and not realize you’re infected.Once you’re infected, the virus stays in your body for life. It’s usually asleep (dormant) but may “wake up” (reactivate) and cause outbreaks. How HSV affects you depends on many factors, including the specific virus type and your overall health.

        There’s no cure for HSV. But treatments can help make outbreaks more manageable while lowering the chances that you’ll spread the virus to others.</p>
