       <h2> Causes </h2>
Herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV)—a highly contagious 
virus that spreads through close contact with an infected person.

Oral herpes is usually caused by HSV-1,
 but it can also be caused by HSV-2.
  It primarily spreads when you come in direct contact with herpes sores or fluids from a herpes blister. 
  Skin-to-skin contact like kissing or sharing personal items like utensils, 
  towels, or lip balm can pass the virus from one person to another. Most people contract oral herpes during childhood from 
  non-sexual saliva contact.7 People in the United States usually contract oral herpes by the age of 20.

Genital herpes is usually caused by HSV-2,
 but it can also be caused by HSV-1. 
 It primarily spreads through sexual contact with someone who has the herpes simplex virus,
  including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. The virus can spread even when someone with the virus has no symptoms. 
  This is known as asymptomatic viral shedding.

Once the virus enters your body, 
it infects nerve cells near the body part that came into contact with the virus. 
It remains dormant in those nerve cells—sometimes for weeks, months, or years—until it reactivates.
 When the virus reactivates, it travels from the nerve endings to the skin or mucous membranes,
  causing a recurrent outbreak.

    <h2>Herpes Symptoms</h2>
Most people with herpes don't experience any symptoms. 
When symptoms do occur, they vary depending on the location and severity of the infection.
<br>
HSV-1 and HSV-2 cause similar symptoms, including:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Itching, burning, or tingling: </b>Many people feel burning, tingling, or itching sensations on their skin 1-2 days before small, fluid-filled blisters appear.</li>
    <li> <b>Blisters: </b>One or more small blisters form on or around the mouth, genitals, or other body parts. Blisters are fluid-filled and eventually rupture, forming crusted sores. Blisters and sores usually last from five days to two weeks. First outbreaks generally last longer than recurrences.</li>
    <li><b>Flu-like symptoms:</b> Swollen lymph nodes in the groin (genital herpes) or neck (oral herpes), fever, headache, and body aches are common, especially during an initial outbreak.</li>
</ul>

    <h3 style="color: white;" >Oral Herpes </h3>
Symptoms of oral herpes typically appear 2-20 days after exposure to HSV and can last up to three weeks. Once infected with HSV-1, you can get recurrent cold sores that usually appear in the same area as your first outbreak.

<ul >Symptoms of oral herpes include:
<li>Small fluid-filled blisters on your lips, gums, mouth, or throat</li>
<li>Red, swollen skin around the blisters </li>
<li>Yellow, crusted sores (ulcers) that eventually scab and heal without leaving scars</li>
<li>Pain when swallowing, eating, or talking</li></ul>

 Recurrent outbreaks typically don't last as long.


    <ul>Symptoms of genital herpes include:
        <li>Small, painful blisters on and around the labia, cervix, penis, scrotum, anus, thighs, buttocks, or inside the vagina</li>
        <li>Shallow, red, painful ulcers that form after blisters break open and crust over and heal within 1-2 weeks</li>
