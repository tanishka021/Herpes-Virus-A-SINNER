   <p> There is no cure for herpes, but treatment focuses can help reduce the frequency and severity 
    of outbreaks, relieve symptoms, and lower your risk of transmitting the virus to others. Mild outbreaks typically clear up on their own within a few weeks.
     Severe or frequent outbreaks usually require treatment</p>
     <br>
    <h2> Medications </h2>
<p>Antiviral drugs treat primary (first) and recurrent herpes outbreaks. They are usually taken orally (by mouth). Antivirals commonly prescribed to treat herpes include:
<br>
<h3>* Zovirax (acyclovir)</h3><br>

 <p>The dosage and duration of antiviral drug treatment depend on whether you're experiencing your 
    first outbreak or a recurrence. Your first episode will likely be treated with a 7-10 day prescription
     of oral antiviral medications.</p>

<h4>Different medication strategies are also used depending on the frequency of your outbreaks.</h4>


<ul>
<b> <li> Episodic therapy:</b> This type of therapy might be used if you have fewer than six outbreaks yearly. You only take medication when you have symptoms. Episodic therapy does not reduce the risk of future outbreaks.</li><br>
<b ><li> Suppressive therapy: </b>This type of therapy might be used if you have six or more outbreaks yearly or if you have a weakened immune system. You take medication daily, regardless of whether or not you have symptoms. Suppressive therapy reduces the frequency and duration of future outbreaks.</li><br>
</ul>

    <b> <h2>Home Remedies </h2></b>
    Home remedies for herpes may help relieve pain and discomfort while you heal, but they do not help shorten the duration of an outbreak.
    
    If you have an outbreak of oral or genital herpes, these at-home treatments may help you feel more comfortable:
    <ul><li>Cold compresses: Place a cloth-covered ice pack on the sores to soothe the pain. Do not keep the ice on your skin for more than a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Take a warm bath: Warm water can provide temporary relief for sores. If you have pain when urinating, urinating in the water at the end of your bath may help dilute the urine so it does not burn the sores.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching sores: Do not touch, scratch, or rub the sores. This also helps lower the risk of spreading the virus to other areas of your body and other people.</li>
    <li>Keep the affected area clean and dry: This lowers the risk of sores becoming infected with bacteria and helps promote healing.</li>
    <li>Lysine supplements: Research suggests that lysine supplements may help reduce recurrent outbreaks and shorten the duration of outbreaks.</li>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
Preventing herpes is not always possible since many people acquire the HSV-1 infection during childhood. Not everyone with herpes has symptoms, and many people with oral and genital herpes are unaware they have it. That said, you can take preventive steps to reduce your risk of contracting or spreading the infection.

<h3>Preventive strategies include:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Practice safer sex:</b>Use condoms and dental dams during sexual activity. The virus can spread without active blisters or sores, but using protection reduces the risk.</li>
    <li><b>Practice abstinence during outbreaks:</b> Avoid close contact (including kissing and sex) with your sexual partner if either of you has an outbreak of oral or genital herpes.</li>
    <li><b>Do not share personal items:</b>Do not share items such as towels, toothbrushes, utensils, or drinks. </li>
    <li><b>Get tested:</b>If you are sexually active, get tested regularly for sexually transmitted infections, including genital herpes.</li>
</ul>
